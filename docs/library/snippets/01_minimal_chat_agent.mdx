title: Snippet 01: Minimal Chat Agent
description: Smallest synchronous AFK agent run.
---

```python
from afk.agents import Agent
from afk.core import Runner

agent = Agent(name="chat", model="gpt-4.1-mini", instructions="Answer directly with concrete detail.")
runner = Runner()
result = runner.run_sync(agent, user_message="Define error budget in SRE.")
print(result.output_text)
```

Expected: one terminal `completed` result with concise text output.
