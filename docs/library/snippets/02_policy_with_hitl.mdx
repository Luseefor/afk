title: Snippet 02: Policy with Human Interaction
description: Route sensitive actions through policy and human approval.
---

```python
from afk.agents import Agent
from afk.core import Runner

agent = Agent(
    name="change-manager",
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    instructions="Ask for approval before any destructive action.",
)

runner = Runner()  # provide policy_engine + interaction_provider in production
result = runner.run_sync(agent, user_message="Drop old production tables")
print(result.state)
```

Expected: policy/interaction events gate execution path.
