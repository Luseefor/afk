title: Snippet 04: Resume and Compact
description: Resume interrupted runs and compact retained thread memory.
---

```python
result = await runner.resume(agent, run_id="run_123", thread_id="thread_abc")
print(result.state)

compaction = await runner.compact_thread(thread_id="thread_abc")
print(compaction)
```

Expected: resumed execution or explicit checkpoint corruption error.
