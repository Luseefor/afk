```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from afk.tools import tool

class DeleteArgs(BaseModel):
    resource_id: str

@tool(args_model=DeleteArgs, name="delete_resource", description="Delete one resource by id")
def delete_resource(args: DeleteArgs) -> dict[str, str]:
    # Keep destructive tools tightly scoped and policy-gated.
    return {"deleted": args.resource_id}
```
