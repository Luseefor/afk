## Implementation order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define contracts">
    Add/update models and protocols first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement behavior">
    Keep orchestration and adapters separated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test failure semantics">
    Validate retry/terminal/cancel behavior explicitly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document usage">
    Add runnable examples and operational notes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Coding Agents

Use this checklist before finalizing changes:

- did I preserve module boundaries?
- did I classify failures clearly?
- did I add examples that show real usage?
- did I add tests for edge cases?

## Quality commands

```bash
uvx ruff format .
uvx ruff check .
PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q
```
