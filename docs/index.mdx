title: AFK
description: Build production-ready agent systems with policy, tools, memory, and provider-agnostic LLM orchestration.
---

AFK (Agent Forge Kit) is an agent runtime focused on safe orchestration, deterministic behavior, and practical developer experience.

<Tip>
Language roadmap: examples currently use the Python SDK. TypeScript, Go, and Rust SDK docs are planned.
</Tip>

## Executive Summary

- AFK provides a production-oriented runtime for tool-using, policy-governed agents.
- The documentation is organized from onboarding to internals to full API contracts.
- Use maturity levels to implement capabilities in the right order.

## When to Use AFK

- engineers building AI features with strict runtime controls
- teams shipping long-running or resumable agent workflows
- platform developers integrating multiple model providers behind one contract

## What You Can Build with AFK

- Chat and task-oriented agents with typed tools
- Policy-gated tool execution with human approval flows
- Subagent orchestration and routing
- Resume-safe long-running workflows with checkpoints
- Provider-agnostic LLM integrations

## Build by Level

1. Level 1: Prompted Agent
2. Level 2: Tool Agent
3. Level 3: Governed Agent
4. Level 4: Durable Agent
5. Level 5: Multi-Agent System
6. Level 6: Production Agentic Platform

Use: [Agentic System Levels](/library/agentic-levels)

| Level | Required Features |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | prompt strategy (`instructions` or prompt file), model selection |
| 2 | typed tools + argument validation + tool descriptions |
| 3 | policy/HITL + sandbox/output controls |
| 4 | checkpointing + resume behavior |
| 5 | subagent routing + context boundaries |
| 6 | budgets/fallback/telemetry + regression tests/evals |
