# AFK Docs Maintenance Playbook

Use this for production-grade docs updates.

## Ordering Rules

1. `Start` section should onboard quickly.
2. `Concepts` should move from fundamentals to advanced runtime behavior.
3. `LLM` section should stay transport/integration focused.
4. `Reference` should contain API and behavioral contracts.

## Page Quality Rules

- keep onboarding pages short and action-oriented
- use diagrams for lifecycle/orchestration behavior
- avoid duplicate explanations across pages
- keep examples aligned to maturity levels
- use valid card icon names only

## Consistency Rules for Concept Pages

Expected sections:

- `When To Read`
- `Required Features`
- `Failure Modes`
- `Examples`
- `Next Step`
