# Icon and Card Guide

Safe icon names currently used in AFK docs:

- `rocket`
- `file-code`
- `play-circle`
- `shield`
- `database`
- `lock`
- `book`
- `folder`
- `code`

## Card Review Checklist

- icon renders correctly in Mintlify UI
- title is action-oriented and short
- card links to the canonical page for that concept
- avoid duplicate cards that point to the same target
